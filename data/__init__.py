Purpose of __init__.py

Package Initialization: 
__init__.py can contain initialization code that is necessary for the package.
This code will run whenever a module from the package is imported.
Namespace Handling: It allows the directory to be treated as a package, so you can import modules from that package.

Manageability: 
It can be used to manage imports and bind the package together. 
This can involve simple imports or more complex ones, configuring logging, or any other initial setup work.
